\Section{Problem Definition}
Natural language often times allows for the omission of parts of a sentence
if the omitted fragment is clear from context. In the english language a
commonly omitted fragment is the agent of an action as in the sentence
`The agent is omitted [by the author]'. We refer to this omitted agent as
an \textit{implicit subject}. For clarity, it should be noted that an implicit
subject is not the same thing as the grammatical subject of a sentence. When referring
to a subject within this text, we are referring to implicit subject unless explicitly
stated otherwise. It should
also be noted that coreference resolution, i.e., determining if multiple words
refer to the same entity, is a distinct problem from this and will not be
discussed further here. 

Though usually clear for a human reader, these implicit subjects can pose a problem
for certain NLP tasks, for example when comparing two or more process descriptions.
If both descriptions contain a fragment akin to `the data shall be kept up to date'
a naive comparison will find the descriptions to match. The responsibility of who
should `keep the data up to date' might differ though if for example one document
is implicitly referring to the data subject and the other to the handling company.

In the following, we will investigate how implicit subjects can be detected and replaced
by explicit ones for the English language following a rule-based approach.

\Section{Methodology}
\subsection{Background}\label{methodology:background}

After a review of available literature we manually inspected documents related
to process descriptions. In detail, we examined the GDPR \cite{gdpr} as an example
of a normative document for other process descriptions and a set of synthetic process
descriptions taken from \cite{NLP_bpm_data}. From this four principal occurrences of
implicit subjects were identified:

\begin{enumerate}
   \item \textbf{The agent of a passive sentences}: The most common form of implicit
   subject is found when using the passive voice. The english language allows for the
   omission of the agent of a verb in the passive voice as is done in our initial example:
   `The agent is omitted [by the author]'.
   \item \textbf{Gerunds}: Another common class of implicit subjects are those accompanying
   gerunds (verbs inflected to end on \textit{-ing}) as is the case in the sentence:
   `[The author] omitting the subject is common.' 
   \item \textbf{Nouns referring to processes}: Often times nouns referring to processes can also
   be supplemented by a subject\footnote{Not in a grammatical sense but rather in a semantic sense.
   The explicit replacement of the implicit version is technically an object.} as is the case in the
   sentence `The omission of a subject [by the author] is possible'. As the boundaries of when a noun
   can accept an agent are ill-defined we focus on a subset of these nouns, namely nominalized
   gerunds, e.g., `The processing of data [by the controller] must be monitored'. As nominalized gerunds
   are always deduced from a verb, they can generally be assumed to implicitly reference an agent, if 
   the reference is not explicit. The important task of widening the class of inspected nouns is
   left to future work.
   \item \textbf{Imperatives}: Imperative verbs can also be considered as implicitly referring to
   a subject, namely the reader of the text, i.e., `you' as can be seen in the sentence
   `[You] omit the agent'.
\end{enumerate}

We do not claim this list to be exhaustive but found it to be sufficient to describe the inspected data.
The implicit subject for each of these types can and must be deduced from the context in which the
instance occurs.
Each of these classes requires also differ in how the found subject is inserted into the corresponding
sentence.

\subsection{Pipeline}
Our goal is to provide an end-to-end pipeline to first detect the absence of an explicit subject where one
can be inserted, find the correct subject to insert from user provided context, and finally
insert the identified subject into the corresponding sentence, creating again a well-formed sentence. 

Based on these observations and goals we have devised a four step process. First, we identify detect
instances of the types of implicit subjects outlined above. This instance will in the following be 
referred to as the \textit{target}. In parallel to this, we create a list of possible
candidates for insertion from the context. This list is created purely from the context without regard
for the targeted implicit subject. In practice the set of candidates consists of all grammatical
subjects and objects in the context as any of them might in theory be the searched for implicit subject.
This step sacrifices precision for high recall.
Only in the next step are the candidates run through an array of filters sensitive to the target.
In theory, this filter chain may return any number of number of candidates. In practice though, it is
designed in a way as to always provide exactly one candidate. Else we can conceptually pick at random.
We will elaborate on the choice of filters in a subsequent section. % TODO more specific
Lastly, this selected candidate must be inserted into the original sentence.


\subsection{Candidate Extraction}
% not 100% recall but probably only mention in the evaluation.
Candidates are extracted by passing the context through a dependency parser and extracting every word that
appears as either the subject or the object in a phrase. Each word is extracted alongside its dependents.
We can this differentiate between for example the word flow appearing as the head of `the process flow'
or appearing as the head of `a similar flow'. At this stage a very large number of false positives
are provided as well as candidates that we do not want to use, for example due to them being a pronoun
and thus providing little additional information without a subsequent pass of a coreference resolution
algorithm.


\subsection{Implicit Subject Detection}
For each the classes mentioned in \ref{methodology:background} distinct extraction rules were developed.

\subsubsection{Passive sentences}
Using a part-of-speech tagger, we can extract verbs in the past participle. We remove verbs that
already have an agent as a dependency and those that have a subject in the active voice.
Though technically also verbs in the passive voice without subject we also remove those that
serve as an adverbial modifier as they tend to not take an agent in natural speech.
Further, there exists a set of passive verbs that in general do not take an agent.
For example the construct `based on' qualifies as a verb in the passive voice without an agent,
but cannot be logically assigned an agent.  

\subsubsection{Gerunds}
Similarly, again using a POS tagger, we can directly detect present participles and filter those
out that already have a subject as a dependency. We further prune this set by removing gerunds that
act as adverbial modifiers as their subject is the sentence fragment being modified. 


\subsubsection{(Gerundive) Nouns}
% \cite{pattern_library}
To detect instances of gerundive nominalization, we search for nouns with suffix \textit{-ing}.
We then inspect the stem obtained by removing this suffix. If this stem is in turn a verb, we can
assume the original noun to be a nominalized gerund and be able to take a subject.
Note how we must rely solely on the orthography of the stem. We thus use a predefined list of
English verbs taken from \cite{pattern_library}.
As we will see in the evaluation, this reliance on orthography can cause problems, for example
with homographs.
Note also that this approach may be generalized by using a general stemmer on the inspected noun instead
of only removing the \textit{-ing} suffix. We found this approach to detect too many nouns though.

\subsubsection{Imperative}
Imperatives are again easily detected by a POS tagger. We simply filter for verbs in their base
form and disregard those that have an auxiliary verb accompanying them. 



\subsection{Candidate Filtering}
% Mention assembly methods
Conceptually, the candidate filtering can be thought of as a structured ensemble model.
Multiple filtering steps are chained together to produce a final output. In the following
we will present some possible filters.


\subsubsection{Imperative Filter}
We begin with a simple filter to demonstrate the modus operandi of our filters in general, namely
the imperative filter. If the target detection is an imperative, no elaborate
search must be undertaken as the subject in question is always `you'. Thus, if an imperative
is detected we can filter the list of candidates to only those whose text is `you', creating
a new `you' candidate if needed. If the inspected target is not an imperative we simply
pass on the entire set of candidates to the next filter in the chain. As this filter
has virtually perfect recall, it is best placed at the beginning of the chain.
