pages="401--416",
abstract="In order to assure process compliance, a wide range of regulatory requirements from various documents must be considered. These external requirements are typically transformed into internal requirements such as policies or handbooks for process compliance in an organization. The transformation is mostly done manually, without the ability of a digitalized quality check. To support users, this work provides a semi-automatic approach based on state-of-the-art NLP algorithms. We first provide a list of Regulatory Compliance Assessment Solution Requirements (RCASR) based on which deviations between external and internal textual requirements can be detected and the root cause of the deviations can be identified. This detailed analysis helps to find mitigation actions in order to improve process compliance. The proposed approach is evaluated based on two Case studies with greatly varying regulatory documents and their realizations by companies. The evaluation demonstrates the feasibility of the approach and provides further insights into the applicability of NLP-based automation techniques in the field of process compliance assurance and management.",

title = {Open information extraction from the web},
year = {2007},

address = {San Francisco, CA, USA},
abstract = {Traditionally, Information Extraction (IE) has focused on satisfying precise, narrow, pre-specified requests from small homogeneous corpora (e.g., extract the location and time of seminars from a set of announcements). Shifting to a new domain requires the user to name the target relations and to manually create new extraction rules or hand-tag new training examples. This manual labor scales linearly with the number of target relations.This paper introduces Open IE (OIE), a new extraction paradigm where the system makes a single data-driven pass over its corpus and extracts a large set of relational tuples without requiring any human input. The paper also introduces TEXTRUNNER, a fully implemented, highly scalable OIE system where the tuples are assigned a probability and indexed to support efficient extraction and exploration via user queries.We report on experiments over a 9,000,000 Web page corpus that compare TEXTRUNNER with KNOWITALL, a state-of-the-art Web IE system. TEXTRUNNER achieves an error reduction of 33\% on a comparable set of extractions. Furthermore, in the amount of time it takes KNOWITALL to perform extraction for a handful of pre-specified relations, TEXTRUNNER extracts a far broader set of facts reflecting orders of magnitude more relations, discovered on the fly. We report statistics on TEXTRUNNER's 11,000,000 highest probability tuples, and show that they contain over 1,000,000 concrete facts and over 6,500,000 more abstract assertions.},
