========== file:  LATEX.TXT =======================

The following files contain the LaTeX macros necessary for you to format 
your paper based on the instructions/measurements in the INSTRUCT.TXT 
attachment in our standard author kit for 8.5 x 11-inch proceedings. 
The files appear in the following order:

latex8.sty -- the style file
latex8.tex -- the main macro set
latex8.bib -- the sample bibliography macros
latex8.bst -- the bibliography main macro set

Note that both current versions of LaTeX, 2e and 2.09, have the same 
macros -- refer to the start of the latex8.sty file for the opening 
statement for each.
