Approaching Information System Challenges with Natural Language Processing - Finding Implicit Subjects
==============================

This project tackles the challenge of identifying implicit subjects in legal text by employing a rule based approach

## Installation

I recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) for setting up the environment and all dependencies.

Run:

```console
conda env create -f env.yml
```

to create the `is-with-nlp-implicit-subject` environment on your machine and:

```console
conda activate is-with-nlp-implicit-subject
```

to select it.

coreferee requires an additional download which can be done from the console (with an active Anaconda environment.
spaCys packages should be installed by conda):

```console
python -m coreferee install en
```

## Project Plan

Categories of implicit subjects:

- Passive sentence without nsubj
- Imperative
-
