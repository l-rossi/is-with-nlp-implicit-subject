    #   Stand in the desert... Near them, on the sand,
    #   Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
    #   And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
    #   Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
    #   Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
    #   The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;
    #   And on the pedestal, these words appear:
    #   My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;
    #   Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!
    #   Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
    #   Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare
    #   The lone and level sands stretch far away."
